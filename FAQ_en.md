Can I freeze/defrost apps faster?

	To install as system app:
	1. Download apk from "Settings" - "Check Update", you can rename the apk if you want
	2. Backup Cold Launcher data using Titanium Backup
	3. Uninstall Cold Launcher
	4. Copy apk of Cold Launcher (1.4.6 and above) to /system/priv-app/ using Root Explorer (For Andorid 4.2 it's /system/app/)
	5. Reboot
	6. Restore Cold Launcher data using Titanium Backup
	7. Launch Cold Launcher
	8. Note: You must install apk to /system/priv-app/ unless you don't have this folder, because apps in /system/app/ don't have advanced permission, so new freeze method won't work!
